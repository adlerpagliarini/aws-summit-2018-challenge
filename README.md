# AWS Challenge

Build a simple servce that integrates to [this simple API](https://aws-challenge.quintoandar.com.br/apidocs/). We expect you to create a simple form that submits your name and email to the API. There are two paths you can take to acheive this:


## Build and Deploy

Build a simple front, but deploy it to the cloud using our CI.

## Build a PWA frontend

Using react, you should build a form to submit your infos, making a request to this [API](https://aws-challenge.quintoandar.com.br/apidocs/) and exhibiting the `msg` returned;

TODOs:

  - Clone this repo and start the project using `npm start`, it will run on `localhost:3000`;
  - Create a page that looks like the following, you can use [material-ui components](https://material-ui.com/):

  - Validate that all fields are filled:

  - Display the response `msg` returned by the API:
