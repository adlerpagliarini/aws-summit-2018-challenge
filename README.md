# AWS Challenge

Build a simple servce that integrates to [this simple API](https://aws-challenge.quintoandar.com.br/apidocs/). We expect you to create a simple form that submits your name and email to the API. There are two paths you can take to acheive this:


## Build and Deploy

Build a simple front, but deploy it to the cloud using our CI.

## Build a PWA frontend

## Both

Do both and win a special treat.
